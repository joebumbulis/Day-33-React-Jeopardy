## Day 33: React Jeopardy

### Explorer Mode

### Build a game of Jeopardy!
Using a fresh clone of the webpack-starter
#####You should include:
* a 'start page' to add your name before starting to play.
* a game board with 6 categories, each category containing 5 questions worth 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000 points
* a question page or modal that shows the question when you click on it in the game board.
* an input field to type in the correct answer.
* a total point value for how many points you've received.
* Think about how many components you will have.
* Think about what state will need to exist outside your components and in the store's application state.

####NOTES
PLANNING PLANNING PLANNING! Don't skimp on the planning, you have a whole 4 days for this project!

* What components do you want to make?
* What different things will the components do?
* Do they have any special methods on them?
* What data do you need from the API?
* How will you get it? (Hint: Actions and the Store)
* POLISH! No matter what level of this assignment you complete, I want you to work on giving it polish. This means both the UI, as well as your code, the explanation of your process/planning (in your README.md).

### WHAT TO SUBMIT
A link to a your repository
In the Notes section, include a link to your project live on the internet
As always, in the Notes section, include your confidence (1-5) and if you are anything below 5, briefly explain why.

####Adventurer Mode (Complete as many as possible)

Instead of having an input field, use Google's webkitSpeechRecognition to evaluate a user's answers to each question.
Add a timer for people to answer the question.
Add an 'admin' screen that lets you create/edit bonus questions.
All bonus questions should be stored on backendless.
Bonus questions should be mixed into to normal questions.

####Epic Mode

Instead of 1 player, have three players!
Create a Leaderboard where you keep track of players scores
Allow 'anonymous' players, but keep track of their acct so that if they opt to create an account later they can keep their scores
Incorporate other game features, such as double jeopardy, daily double, and final jeopardy
